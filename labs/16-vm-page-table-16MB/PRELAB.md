### Prelab

We're going to do page tables.    These were covered in the documents from the 
previous lab:
 - `armv6.b4-mmu.annot.pdf`:  page tables for the general armv6 architecture.
 - `arm1176-vm.annot.pdf`: the arm1176 description.
 - [VM-CHEATSHEET.md](../12-pinned-vm/VM-CHEATSHEET.md): from last lab:
   cheat sheet of different VM page numbers.
