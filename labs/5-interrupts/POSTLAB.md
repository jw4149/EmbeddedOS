## Interrupt lab retrospective.

This was an intense lab. But the results will serve you well over the 
quarter.  You now have complete, self-contained examples of:
   1. Interrupts: you can print out these small number of pages, iterate
      over and understand every little piece.
   2. An interrupt kernel level analysis tool.  This demonstrates how a 
      simple system makes it easy to turn simple ideas into working code.
      Imagine th difficulty doing the same tool in Linux even at user level,
      much less kernel.
   3. System calls: just like interrupts you can print out this number of pages
      read them all until you get everything.   T

   4. Getting more ffamiliar with lookin gat the machine code and reading/writing
      assembly.

At this point a lot of this will feel ike "I did A, and that failed so I did
B and that failed so I did C and that worked, so, don.e"  will understand
more.

should read the chapter two: will make much more sense.  Then re-read the 
code, that will also make more sense.

Really want to udnerstand everything here.  you will have a solid place
to stand, can easily take steps in different directions.
