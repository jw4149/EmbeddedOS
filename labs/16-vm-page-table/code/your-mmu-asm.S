@ Must carefully read B2 of the armv6 manual.  You cannot rely on "well it
@ worked on my test case": mistakes cause stale data, which may or may not
@ show up in your test case (likely not) despite being wildly broken.
@
@ Note: Rd is allegedly a read-only parameter to these instructions, but
@ the manual says SBZ (should be zero).  I think (and the linux source seems
@ to think) that this means we have to explicitly set it to 0.  Not setting
@ Rd=0 is an easy mistake to make.  Perhaps is worth building in (Linux does
@ not, but) --- the cost of an extra mov is negligible given our other 
@ overheads.
@
@ Alot of people put these instructions in inline assembly, wrapped up by 
@ function calls (e.g., cs107e's MMU code).  This practice is dangerous. 
@ For example, if you are flushing caches, you cannot be sure that the 
@ function return, etc does not then reload them, esp w.r.t. the BTB.  I 
@ think the only safe approach is to put directly in assembly so you are 
@ guaranteed no branch, indirect jump, load/store happens in between.
@
@ A lot of MMU code out there appears pretty broken b/c they don't do enough
@ flushing operations and/or rely on gcc code generation to not do the above.

    @ note: this piece of code is mapped into the sample place in both

    @ very hard to get right (perhaps impossible?) since we cannot flush
    @ the BTB and prefetch and switch MMU on/off atomically.  thus, would
    @ flush, but instructions could get fetched before we could disable,
    @ defeating the purpose.
