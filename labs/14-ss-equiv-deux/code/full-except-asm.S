@ this file defines the trampolines used to forward exception/interrupts
@ to <full-except.c>
@
@ each should:
@   1. save all the registers (spsr, r0-r15) onto the stack
@      in a <regs_t> layout.  (as before: r0 at offset 0, 
@      r1 at byte offset 4, etc)
@
@   2. call the associated full except handler in <full-except.c>
@
@      the key property: if we call <switchto> on these 
@      saved registers execution should resume in "the
@      right place"  --- for exceptions/interrupts
@      exactly where the exception occured, for the
@      system call one instructon after.
@
@  currently we only define three full exception handlers, you can 
@  add the rest.

#include "rpi-asm.h"

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@  
@ these are the non "full except" handlers that work just like all
@ the exceptions/interrupts we've done so far this quarter:
@ just save registers and call the default name.  
@
@ included so you have a handy way to see how to use macros in
@ assembly.
@ 
@ you don't need to modify this (but you can to make everything
@ be a full_except style handler.

@ save all the stuff we need, then call the given routine.

@
@ this is the code you have to write.


@ save all registers into a <regs_t> (same as last lab)
@ and call the full-except.c:prefetch_abort_full_except
@ handler.

@ what to do:
@  1. load the stack into sp
@  2. adjust lr;
@  3. save all the regs into a <regs_t>
@  3. call <full-except.c:prefetch_abort_full_except> with
@       <reg_t> in <r0>
@       <spsr> in <r1>
@       <pc> in <r2>
@
@ NOTE: 
@  - save registers assuming we come from user mode.
@    <full-except.c> will patch up if needed.
@  - the pc in <regs> should point to the instruction that
@    faulted.
